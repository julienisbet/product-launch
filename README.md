## Whirlwind tour of layouts
- Tables
- Block, inline, inline-block
- Float
- position: relative, absolute
- Flex
- Grid

- Look at the outermost parent. 
    - Ask, is this rows or columns?
    - Describe the width of the rows (or height of the columns) in terms of percents
    - Repeat this step for each row or column child.
- Label all elements that have rows or columns insdie them. 
- Give these elements css classes. 
    - Each one that has rows gets `display: grid` and `grid-template-rows: 50% 50%`.
    - Each one that has columns gets `display: grid` and `grid-template-columns: 50% 50%`.
